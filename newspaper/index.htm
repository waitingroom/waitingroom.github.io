																						A conversation about the journey of objects when they travel.

																				<div class="col-1">
																					<b>Q:</b> The book "Taxing Art" by Beta Tank explains how the Value Added Tax (VAT) is applied to an object in two ways in Germany.
																					The object categorized as functional is more expensive than the object considered art or non-functional.
																					In your case (Switzerland and specially República Austral), how does the categorization of objects work? How do they see affected by this?<br><br>
																					<b>A:</b> In Switzerland it is the same: Artworks are exempt from value added tax (VAT) if the artwork is worked by the artist himself and produced by his own hand.
																					The artwork must be free of purpose, i. e. exclusively intended or suitable for contemplation (images, paintings, sculptures, statues and decorative works of art).
																					As soon as the artworks are produced in series, they are considered as craft products and therefore VAT is applied.
																					The case of Republica Austral is different for several reasons: Our objects are created by our designers and not by ourselves, even if we can give impulses or guidelines.
																					They are produced in small series, some are functional, others destined to art galleries.
																					Therefore, the design objects of Republica Austral are subject to VAT, which here in Switzerland is at 8%.

																					<b>Q:</b>
																					After the creation of República Austral, what changed in your perception regarding international policies about design,
																					having Switzerland and South America as examples?
																					 <br><br>
																					<b>A:</b>
There are several factors that directly influence us, we would like to highlight two. Free
trade agreements first. We work with Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and the political
and economic situation of each country is very different. For example, with Chile
Switzerland signed a free trade agreement in 2004 and trade relations in general are
very good. This affects Republica Austral in the sense that our objects are totally or
partially exempt from customs duties. On the other hand, Argentina and Uruguay are
part of MERCOSUR and only in January 2017 a declaration of intent has been signed to
retake negotiations for a free trade agreement between MERCOSUR and EFTA
(European Free Trade Association that includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and
Liechtenstein). It can take years until an agreement is reached. Especially in the case
of Argentina, today we are confronted with an incomparable bureaucracy that makes
the export and cash flow processes considerably more difficult. In all cases, it is
essential for us that designers collaborate closely with us and help us, for example, to
find the best shipping solution and improve export processes.
Secondly, we would mention currency fluctuations. In general, developing countries
that are heavily dependent on the export of primary resources such as copper, gas or
oil are showing greater currency fluctuations. In the case of Argentina, a significant
inflation is added to the Argentine peso. This inevitably affects us and the time factor –
the right moment to make an investment - is very important and at the same time
difficult to anticipate.

																					<b>Q:</b>
																					 In which way you think government policies affect creativity and innovation?
																					<br><br>
																					<b>A:</b>
																						There are several factors. In Switzerland, for example, we have a dual education
	system, i. e. academic education is complemented by a direct and practice-oriented
	vocational education. During an apprenticeship of 3 to 4 years young people are
	trained directly in companies, completed for 1 to 2 days per week of school classes.
	The vast majority of young people take this path and only minorities follow an
	academic education. This educational system is a fundamental factor for Switzerland's
	innovative capacity and economic efficiency because there is a close relationship
	between business and training. Moreover, Switzerland is a country that does not have
	any primary resources such as oil, gas or metals. Historically the country was forced to
	take other paths and since the 19th century it began to create industries based on
	technological progress. Initially it was mainly the textile and watchmaking industries,
	then the industries of precision machinery and the service sector such as tourism,
	banks etc. began to develop. Innovation in Switzerland is almost 100 percent linked to
	technological progress, which is also reflected in the creations of local designers. As
	mentioned above, in South America creativity and innovation come out of a resource
	constraint. Creators are forced to investigate new production processes and generally
	develop them together with their artisans because they depend on their capacity.
	Then there are also more practical ways to encourage creativity and innovation.
	Governments can award scholarships to study abroad or to present design objects at
	leading fairs in Europe. Chile has promoted it a lot in previous years, Uruguay currently
	has very active institutions that promote Uruguayan design inside and outside the
	country. On the other hand, in Argentina we don't observe many activities in this sense
	and designers depend on themselves.

																					<b>Q:</b>
																					How do the distance and the mailing international policies affect the designers who collaborate with you?
																					<br><br>
																					<b>A:</b>
																					Transport is undoubtedly one of our biggest challenges. The distances are very long
and the economies are relatively small, resulting in very high transport costs. This has
a direct replica in sales prices. At the same time, in order to be able to compete in the
European market it is necessary that we position ourselves with a good quality/price
ratio, at the cost of a lower profit margin. This also has implications for our designers.
They have to constantly seek to improve their production processes in order to
produce more efficiently or to find ways to reduce the weight and volume of shipments
without impairing functionality and especially the quality of objects.

	<br>
	<b>Q:</b>
	Living in Valencia, what role do you think art or design plays in geopolitics today?<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	Our globalized society is in a virtual territory that is very powerful and has many possibilities to approach many aspects. I am not sure that the real art circuit works like international biennials where each pavilion seeks to stop declaring or creating an image of a country. Most artists respond to codes that do not represent a specific culture or territory, but aesthetic sensibilities. It is not my intention to ignore political art, specific place or art that speaks of the situations of countries or cultures that of course exists, is very powerful and has a presence. Here in Spain the topic of colonialism and postcolonialism has a great presence and is carried out mostly by Latin artists, we will always find artists who speak from their first physical and political territory but nevertheless what he avenged here in Valencia is homogenization of art, to be many times inadequate suitor to attribute a specific and intentional cultural root to a work or in case of a caricature and cultural appropriation.

</div>
<div class="col-1">
	I must add that I feel that art develops hegemonically in certain cultural capitals -euroamerican, and others in the East-, which are not expanding, nor are they developing in different territories, which means a migration of creators towards them, fostering the concentration, elitization and segregation of art, making its actuality only accessible to those who have the means to access these, the artistic circuit being inserted in the dynamics of capital domination.
